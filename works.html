            <h1>Joel Mandelbaum: Catalogue Of Works</h1>
            <p>This version of my catalogue of works with commentary was originally prepared for Ronald Roseman in 1997
                for
                his reference in selecting repertory for the new music
                group at Queens College. I have since added commentary regarding other works. This version has been
                renumbered to reflect my evolving views as to which works to be
                numbered and which not, and which short works to be combined for purposes of numbering and which to
                leave
                alone. A number (opus or catalogue number) can mean
                anything from a two-and-a-half-hour opera to a two-minute song. Where very short works from
                approximately
                the same period, or the same text author and the same
                genre could sensibly be rolled into one catalogue number I have done so, but in some cases a very short
                work
                has been left standing alone.</p>

                work a number. It was written to put a humorous spin on a

                of Interlochen with humor, and performed
                at the all-camp party on the 13th of August, 1951. It would not have been possible without a host of
                volunteer copyists. David Klein was
                concertmaster and producer. John Dalley (later of the Guarneri String Quartet), whose imitation
                wolf-whistle, played throughout the summer, is
                featured near the end of the 2nd movement, was assistant concertmaster. I like the work but by now
                am
                probably the only person who remembers how it
                goes. Scores and parts are exactly in the shape they were left on Aug. 14th, 1951, and I will try to
                have them preserved, but I doubt that they will
                ever be used. Too bad. Perhaps materials should be sent to Interlochen for archival preservation if

                at some future time, enough of my work is validated sufficiently to make the resuscitation of this
                pageant-opera seem worthwhile, an ambitious musicologist
                could reconstruct it from existent materials including the recording of the Harvard premiere, 1957.

                an
                orchestral program. The middle song is a duet and, I think, works quite effectively by itself. It is
                surrounded by solo songs for each. I think the two baritone songs are stronger than the soprano
                songs
                when taken out of cycle. Perhaps this reflects my view that Roethke the poet speaks more

            <td class="info">Originally written for the QC senior recital of Ellen Haag. It has not been performed
                since. The first two movements are quite compact, while the finale is a rather long rondo. I
                originally
                composed the rondo in A minor, but transposed it to Bb to match the opening movement. I later
                considered
                the transposition a mistake and have written a version in A minor which has never been performed.
                Working with a well-tempered piano, I find that the rondo needs a more consonant home key than Bb
                minor
                to enable the contrasting sections to stand out sufficiently. Though the first two movements exist
                only
                in manuscript, I put the finale into the computer to have available versions in both keys, and would
                enjoy the opportunity to try both out with an interested oboist.</td>

                Saul put his position at risk going over the head of Chancellor Murphy to gain State approval of our
                splendid New Music Building. When our Department wished to honor him on his departure he was asked
                to
                name his favorite poet. He indicated that it was Frost. Through the grapevine I have learned that
                the
                Frost Estate routinely turns down permission requests to set his poems to music, so visible public
                performances must wait until when his copyrights expire, unless the estate changes its policy. These
                are
                some of my best songs. To make the music available without the words, I have recently arranged these
                songs to be played without words by piano trio in a single work, which I call "Waiting for the
                Thaw"(see

            <td class="info">Yet another senior recital piece, this time for Janet Holmes. In 1997, I revised this
                rather extensive piece. I have shortened the first movement by about 4 minutes, and have written a
                new
                finale which can be used if the performers prefer not to use the original one, a comic Quodlibet
                with
                Narrator. The first movement is intensively expressive The second movement is, I think, a very
                original
                scherzo. The third a romanza with a few microtones for the cello. The new finale is tuneful with a
                sad
                ending. The old one (still more than acceptable to me) is playful and has very few notes of my own
                in
                it. To use this finale the cellist must like to (and be able to) imitate animal sounds (especially
                of
                dogs and cats) on the cello. The original finale exists only in manuscript.</td>
