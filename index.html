                Mandelbaum received his Ph.D. from the University of Indiana in Music
                Theory
                in 1961. He also studied at the Harvard and Brandeis Universities, as well as the Berkshire Music Center
                and
                the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik. His composition teachers included Boris Blacher, Luigi Dallapiccola,
                Irving
                Fine, Walter Piston, and Harold Shapero. His thesis was focused on the 19 equal temperament. He was a
                teacher and chairman of the music department at Queens College of the City University of New York from
                1961
                to 1999.
                Mandelbaum became interested in microtonality after listening to a lecture by Paul Hindemith in which
                Hindemith inadequately debunked various alternative forms of tuning. He began a correspondence with
                Adriaan
                Fokker which led to a six-week stay in Haarlem in 1963, during which he composed music using Euler's
                genera
                under Fokker's tutelage. The result was "10 Studies in 31-Tone Temperament", which premiered on the
                Fokker
                organ in Haarlem.
                Mandelbaum's motivation to use the 31 equal temperament arose from its close approximation to just
                intonation; Mandelbaum preferred the equal temperament to just tuning out of convenience, as it produced
                one
                tuning of a keyboard with which it was possible to explore approximations of chords to just tuning in
                any
                key. Although well known for exploring alternate tunings, Mandelbaum still uses conventional tuning in
                about
                80% of his music. Mandelbaum attributes his use of conventional tuning to his reluctance to use keyed
                instruments (such as woodwinds) in tunings other than those that they were designed for.
                Mandelbaum's music has been recorded on Capstone and Ravello (Parma Records).
